# zcoin-paper-js
Paper wallet generator for zcoin

Forked from https://github.com/cantonbecker/bitcoinpaperwallet and modified for Zcoin use.

Although we host a web version of it on http://zcoinpaperwallet.com we do recommend running it locally instead for those who have the technical know how.

*** HOW TO USE THIS GENERATOR ***

1) Extract the ZIP file
2) Open up the 'index.html' file with your web browser. 
3) If you like you can select a different language or holiday theme
4) Follow the steps for calibrating your printer and then printing
   the front and back of each wallet. Use landscape mode when printing!
   
Rendering and printing seems to work best using: 

   OS X:     Safari or Chrome or Firefox
   Windows:  Firefox or Chrome
   Linux:    Firefox

When using Chrome on Windows, use the Chrome print dialog. Switching to the
Windows system print dialog will produce corrupted/illegible keys.

QR scanning works best using Firefox since Chrome will not access the camera controls
when opening a locally saved HTML file.
